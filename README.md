Project Birdseye Documentation
==============================

What is this?
---------
This is basically a shell project for documentation. Nothing except this README.md will ever be in this
repository. For more information about the project and as-we-go documentation, head over to the
[Wiki](https://github.com/noctrl/project-birdseye-doc/wiki).

Project Overview
----------------
Welcome to the General Project Wiki for Project Birdseye, a project by an intrepid group of students from North Central College's **No Ctrl**, a Computer Science club started in May 2012. The club's focus is iterative, team-based software development, and **with this project we hope to learn a great deal while working toward a useful cause: tracking parking in the campus lots.**

Goal
----
In the last couple of years Naperville, IL deployed their own *very* high cost parking solution. Our campus leaders are skeptical that we can develop a similar (read: *cheaper*) system using a Raspberry Pi, some sensors, and some old-fashioned sweat, but we believe we can.

Outlook
-------
This project is currently under development, but throughout the process we will keep all of the information about our project on GitHub for ourselves and anybody else who would like to follow our project. Project Birdseye is expected to enter alpha within the coming months, and beta sometime in early Fall. Once the latter happens, we will begin accepting pull requests from anyone who wishes to contribute.
